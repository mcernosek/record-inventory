A simple SpringBoot web app that manages home record inventory. 

Project is based off of the below tutorial under "Attributions".

Technologies Utilized:
- SpringBoot
- Spring Framework
- Spring Data JPA
- H2 In Memory Database


Next phase of the project is to build out a UI that consumes the API. The tutorial outlines how to do this using Angular but I am working on building it with React instead.
